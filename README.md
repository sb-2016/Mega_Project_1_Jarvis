## README: Voice-Controlled Assistant (Jarvis)

### Introduction
This project is a voice-controlled assistant called **Jarvis**. It listens to your voice commands and performs various tasks like opening websites, playing music, reading the news, or even generating AI-based responses. It's designed to make life easier by responding to your voice commands.

### How It Works
1. **Voice Recognition:** The program listens for the keyword "Jarvis." When you say it, Jarvis will respond and wait for your next command.
2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Jarvis can talk back to you using a text-to-speech engine.
3. **Web Control:** You can ask Jarvis to open websites like Google, YouTube, Facebook, or LinkedIn.
4. **Music Playback:** Tell Jarvis to play your favorite songs, and it will open them on YouTube.
5. **News:** Jarvis can fetch and read out the latest news headlines from India.
6. **AI Responses:** If Jarvis doesn't understand your command, it uses AI to try and generate a helpful response.

### What You Need to Run This Program
1. **Python:** The code is written in Python, so you'll need to install Python on your computer.
2. **Libraries:** 
   - `speech_recognition`: To recognize voice commands.
   - `pyttsx3`: For text-to-speech conversion.
   - `pygame`: To play audio files.
   - `gTTS`: Another text-to-speech tool, generating mp3 files.
   - `requests`: To fetch news from the internet.
   - `webbrowser`: To open websites in your browser.
   - `google-generativeai`: To handle advanced AI-based responses.

### Installation
1. **Install Python:** If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Install Libraries:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install all the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 pygame gtts requests google-generativeai
   ```
3. **Music Data:** The `music` dictionary in the code contains a list of songs and their YouTube links. You can customize this list with your favorite songs.

### Running the Program
1. **Start the Program:** Open your terminal or command prompt in the directory where the code is saved, and type:
   ```bash
   python jarvis.py
   ```
2. **Activate Jarvis:** Once the program is running, say "Jarvis" to activate the assistant. Then, give it a command, like:
   - "Open Google"
   - "Play march"
   - "What's the news?"

### Example Commands
- **Open a Website:** "Jarvis, open Google."
- **Play Music:** "Jarvis, play march."
- **Get News:** "Jarvis, what's the news?"
- **AI Response:** If you ask a question or give a command that Jarvis doesn't recognize, it will try to answer using AI.

### Troubleshooting
- **Jarvis Isn't Listening:** Make sure your microphone is working properly.
- **Speech Recognition Errors:** Sometimes, background noise can cause issues. Try speaking more clearly or in a quieter environment.
- **API Errors:** If the news isn't loading, double-check your internet connection and API key.

### Conclusion
This program is a fun way to interact with your computer using your voice. Whether you want to browse the web, listen to music, or get the latest news, Jarvis has you covered. Enjoy experimenting with this code and feel free to expand its capabilities!
